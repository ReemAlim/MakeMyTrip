# MakeMyTrip
Final project in Selenium Automation Bootcamp

- This project contains the flow for reserving an hotel from "MakeMyTrip" website.
- What I have implemented (it is uncompleted project):
  - Login was skipped
  - I have created the flow until selecting a room BUT without applying the logic nor proceeding further

How to run the project:
  - Supposly from the pom.xml but for some reason I couldnt so I run it from the startup.xml directly
  
I have faced some issues while building up the framework:
 - The filter part filthering the two areas togteher doesnt work so I commented one of them BUT the other sometimes doesnt work as while automation for some reason
   the ids get changed will share screenshot for it.
   
 - Waiting for the hotels list container to load sometimes fails didnt get why so the whole test fails.
 
 - Culdnt get the logic for adding the rooms so I couldnt proceed with the flow
 
 - ReservationPageTest is where you will find all the listed tests
 
 NB:
Couldnt upload the screenshots
